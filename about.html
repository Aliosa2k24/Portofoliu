<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ilie-Marian Catuna, I'm 21 years old, I'm from Romania, 
  I am an active and lively person that is eager and curious to learn 
  new things.</p>

<p>I ended the "Alexandru cel Bun" College, mathematics-informatics profile.
  After this I started the Firefighetrs School "Pavel Zaganescu", military 
  foreman profile.
  I played rugby for 9 years, in my team I was the captain because I 
  know how to speak with people in such a way that they understand and 
  to create a conection between them.

  to make sport(gym, rugby, running), to laught, to smile, to make people
